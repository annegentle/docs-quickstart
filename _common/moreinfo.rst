================
This Quickstart is intentionally very brief, demonstrating only a few basic operations. 
If you want to know more, these are some good places to continue exploring:

* http://developer.rackspace.com/ links to all our Software Development Kits. It also offers developer-focused support resources such as our IRC channel.

* http://docs.rackspace.com/ links to all our API reference documentation, where you can find additional examples and extended explanations of key concepts. 
It also links to our documentation for control panel users.

* https://community.rackspace.com/developers/default/ is a forum where you can discuss your questions and concerns with 
a community of Rackers, Rackspace customers, and others interested in developing software in the cloud.
