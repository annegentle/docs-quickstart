Authenticate to gain access to the service
==========================================
To use this service, you must authenticate yourself as a subscriber to the service.
Authenticate by presenting valid Rackspace customer credentials in a ''POST'' to a Rackspace authentication endpoint.

You can use either of two sets of credentials:

* your username and password
* your username and API key

Your username and password are the ones you use to login to the Cloud Control Panel at http://mycloud.rackspace.com/. 
You can obtain or create your API key if you are logged in to the Cloud Control Panel: click on your username, then Account Settings; then under Login Details, you can show or reset your API key. 

After you authenticate, you'll have two things:

* a token, proving that your identity has been authenticated
* a service catalog, listing the API endpoints available to you

To begin interacting with a service, send your token to that service's API endpoint.
