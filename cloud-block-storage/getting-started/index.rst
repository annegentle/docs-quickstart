==================================
Quickstart for Cloud Block Storage
==================================
Rackspace Cloud Block Storage is a block level storage solution that allows customers to mount drives or volumes to their Rackspace Next Generation Cloud Serversâ„¢. The two primary use cases are (1) to allow customers to scale their storage independently from their compute resources, and (2) to allow customers to utilize high performance storage to serve database or I/O-intensive applications.

Concepts
========
To use this service effectively, you should understand how these key ideas are used in this context:

snapshot
    A point-in-time copy of the data that a volume contains. 
    Snapshots are incremental, so each time that you create a snapshot, 
    the incremental changes for the new snapshot are appended to the previous snapshot, which is still available.

volume
    A detachable block storage device. 
    You can think of it as a USB hard drive. 
    You can attach a volume to one instance at a time.

Authenticate to gain access to the service
==========================================
To use this service, you must authenticate yourself as a subscriber to the service.
Authenticate by presenting valid Rackspace customer credentials in a ``POST`` to a Rackspace authentication endpoint.

You can use either of two sets of credentials:

* your username and password
* your username and API key

Your username and password are the ones you use to login to the Cloud Control Panel at http://mycloud.rackspace.com/. 
You can obtain or create your API key if you are logged in to the Cloud Control Panel: click on your username, then Account Settings; then under Login Details, you can show or reset your API key. 

After you authenticate, you'll have two things:

* a token, proving that your identity has been authenticated
* a service catalog, listing the API endpoints available to you

To begin interacting with a service, send your token to that service's API endpoint.

Use the API
===========
These are some of the the basic operations you can perform with this API.

Volume operations
-----------------
You can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on volumes.

Create volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a block storage volume in its basic form:

.. include:: samples/create_volume.rst

List volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To see a list of all the block storage volumes you have created in a single region:

.. include:: samples/list_volumes.rst

Show volume
~~~~~~~~~~~
To inspect a specific volume's state:

.. include:: samples/show_volume.rst

Update volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a volume's display name and/or description:

.. include:: samples/update_volume.rst

Delete volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a volume is no longer in use (attached) and the data it contains is not needed, you can delete it:

.. include:: samples/delete_volume.rst

Note: please be advised that deleting a volume deletes all the data within it and cannot be recovered unless such data was previously backed up.

Snapshot operations
-------------------
You can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on snapshots.

Create snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a snapshot of a block storage volume:

.. include:: samples/create_snapshot.rst

List snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To see all the snapshots you have created in a given region:

.. include:: samples/list_snapshots.rst

Show snapshot details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To inspect detailed metadata of a specific snapshot:

.. include:: samples/show_snapshot.rst

Update snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a snapshot's display name and/or description:

.. include:: samples/update_snapshot.rst

Delete snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To permanently delete a snapshot:

.. include:: samples/delete_snapshot.rst

More information
================
This Quickstart is intentionally very brief, demonstrating only a few basic operations.

* http://docs.rackspace.com/ links to all our API reference documentation, where you can find additional examples and extended explanations of key concepts. It also links to our documentation for Cloud Control Panel users.

* https://community.rackspace.com/developers/default is a forum where you can discuss your questions and concerns with a community of Rackers, Rackspace customers, and others interested in developing software in the cloud.
