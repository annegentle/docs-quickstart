Block storage for Cloud Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using Cloud Block Storage, you can add disk space to your Cloud
Servers by attaching storage volumes.

Cloud Block Storage offers volumes in two flavors:

* Standard (spinning hard disk)

* High-performance (SSD)

Standard volumes are suitable for customers who need traditional
high-capacity storage at a low price point. SSD volumes are suitable for
customers who intend to run databases or other highly-transactional or
high-I/O applications in the cloud.
