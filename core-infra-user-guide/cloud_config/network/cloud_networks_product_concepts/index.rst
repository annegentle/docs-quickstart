Understanding Cloud Networks
============================
Your Cloud Server configuration can include several kinds of networks,
connected as appropriate for your needs.

Typical use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Security**

  Get fully isolated, single-tenant Layer 2 networks designed to securely
  transfer sensitive information between Cloud Servers located in the same
  region.

**Flexibility and control**

  Control IP addressing (IPv4 or IPv6) and topology to create networks
  that suit your workloadâ€”for example, create one network between web and
  app servers, and another between app and database servers.

**High availability**

  Because multiple Cloud Servers can share the same IP address, you can
  use fast IP address failover to enable high availability without making
  a separate API call.

Customer benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are some of the ways in which Cloud Networks can 
be useful within your Cloud Servers configuration: 

* **Isolate your servers**

    You can create Cloud Servers without public or 
    private (ServiceNet) network interfaces, 
    making them accessible only through Cloud Networks.

* **Support clustering** 

    Includes full support for broadcasting and multicasting as 
    required for some clustering technologies.

* **Simplify network changes**

    You can make networking changes to existing deployments 
    without having to rebuild your Cloud Server.

* **Automate network changes**

    Via the Cloud Networks API, 
    you can develop custom software to automatically 
    create networks and attach or detach Cloud Servers 
    based on workload requirements.

* **Support complex topologies**

    Combine with 
    `Brocade Vyatta Routers <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/vrouter/>`__ 
    to create complex topologies that route traffic 
    between Cloud Networks or to external data centers over VPN.

* **Scale networks as you grow** 

    Up to 250 Cloud Servers can be attached to a single cloud network.
    You can have up to 10 cloud networks per region.
