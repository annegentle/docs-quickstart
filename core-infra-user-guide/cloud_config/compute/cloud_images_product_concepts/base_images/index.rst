Creating Cloud Servers from base images
---------------------------------------
You can create a Cloud Server from a Cloud Image that you created,
or you can create it from a Cloud Image that Rackspace created. 

We maintain the Cloud Images that we create; 
you are responsible for maintaining the Cloud Images that you create.
