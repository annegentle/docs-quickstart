Scheduled images
''''''''''''''''
In addition to on-demand images, you have the ability to enable
scheduled images on any servers for which the service is appropriate.
The scheduled images service will automatically create a daily or weekly
image of the server. Remember that a virtual machine image is not really
a backup of a server, so whether scheduled images are an appropriate
solution for you depends entirely on your use case. See the `Scheduled
Images
FAQ <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/scheduled-images-faq>`__
in the Rackspace Knowledge Center for details.
