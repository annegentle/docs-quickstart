Understanding Cloud Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A virtual machine image (“image”, for short) is a single file that
contains a virtual disk that has a bootable operating system on it.
Images come in various formats. In the Rackspace Managed Cloud, we use
images in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) format. The VHD format was
developed by Microsoft and is used by the Microsoft Hyper-V and Citrix
XenServer hypervisors, among others.
