==========================
Preparing for productivity
==========================
Before you begin performing useful work on a Cloud Server or any server,
your first activities on that server should make sure it is
secure, running necessary software, and regularly backed up. These are
good practices in or out of the cloud. Because you probably chose to use
cloud computing to deal with a rapidly-changing workload, and because
billing for cloud services is usage-based, it's especially important for
you to begin two additional good practices now to prepare you to
recognize and respond to usage peaks: establish a monitoring protocol to
alert you to unusual events; establish scaling policies to enable
your configuration to grow as needed.

.. NOTE::
   Securing your own server and establishing your own backups 
   provides a layer of protection that you can control, 
   in addition to that provided by Rackspace's reliable infrastructure.
