Learning more about the Cloud Control Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every cloud account comes with access to the 
`Cloud Control Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__. 
Depending on how you use your Rackspace account, 
you may not be interested in changes to specific  
Rackspace cloud products and services. 
However, the Cloud Control Panel is common ground, 
available to all Rackspace cloud customers, 
and we recommend that all Rackspace customers pay attention 
to ongoing development there. 

Making yourself familiar with these sites 
and keeping up with new information there 
will 
help you become a skillful user of the Cloud Control Panel:

* **Technical documentation** 
  focused on the Cloud Control Panel, 
  including short tutorials and demonstrations, is 
  published in the 
  `Rackspace Knowledge Center <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/>`__. 

* **Announcements of major changes** 
  are published 
  in 
  `Release Notes <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/release_notes>`__.
  
  .. note::
     We continuously improve the Cloud Control Panel;  
     you may see minor changes between one visit and the next. 
     We announce only major changes in Release Notes. 

* **Discussions with customers and Rackers** 
  are open to public participation in the 
  `Rackspace Community <https://community.rackspace.com/>`__.
