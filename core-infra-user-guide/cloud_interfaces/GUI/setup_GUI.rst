Preparing to use the Cloud Control Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel, you need:

* a Web browser
* a Rackspace account
* credentials (username and password) giving you access 
  to that account 
  
Login by launching the browser, opening the Cloud Control Panel's `login page <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/#>`__, 
filling in your credentials, and clicking **Log In**.

The account's credentials are those that were chosen when you, 
or someone else at your account, created a Rackspace 
cloud account.

If you do not have a Rackspace cloud account, 
or if you have forgotten the account's credentials, 
you can use the 
`Need help logging in? <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/#>`__
or 
`Join the Cloud Now <https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/?cid=ccpl1>`__
links from the 
`Cloud Control Panel's login page <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__ 
to get what you need.
