Rackspace implemented 
the OpenStack project named "glance" 
as our Cloud Images product.

The OpenStack tool primarily used for 
managing Cloud Images is written
in Python and called *glance*. 
It is also known as 
*python-glanceclient*.

We recommend that you use the 
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__ 
to install glanceclient, as it will handle installing dependencies and
required packages for you.

OpenStack documents that may help you install glanceclient 
and learn to use it include: 

* `Install the OpenStack command-line clients <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html>`__

* `OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/index.html>`__, 
  especially at 
  `Image service command-line client <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/glanceclient_commands.html>`__ 

* `glance CLI man page <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-glanceclient/man/glance.html>`__
