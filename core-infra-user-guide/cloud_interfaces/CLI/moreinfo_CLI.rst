Learning more about CLIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CLIs that you can use to interact with the Rackspace cloud 
are, or are consistent with, 
the CLIs provided by OpenStack. 

Useful information about these CLIs exists in sources published by 
Rackspace and in sources published by OpenStack:

* `OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/>`__ 
  documents all OpenStack CLIs, whether or not they are 
  in use at Rackspace. 

* In the 
  `Rackspace Community <https://community.rackspace.com/>`__, 
  if you search for relevant keywords 
  such as ``CLI`` or ``command line``, 
  you can find and join useful conversations.
