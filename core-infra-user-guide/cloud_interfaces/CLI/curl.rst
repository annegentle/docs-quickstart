cURL CLI
++++++++
`cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__ 
is a general-purpose command-line tool 
for interacting with REST APIs. 
Using cURL to submit a single request at the command line is 
a common method of experimenting with an API before deciding 
whether to write software to automate that request, 
so 
`Rackspace's API documentation <http://docs.rackspace.com>`__ 
includes 
many cURL-based examples.

You can read basic information about cURL 
in several Rackspace publications, 
including:

* `How cURL commands work <http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cn-gettingstarted/content/curl.html>`__ 
* `Cloud Files cURL Cookbook <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-files-curl-cookbook>`__
* `Authenticate with cURL <http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/curl_auth.html>`__

At the 
`Developer Center <https://developer.rackspace.com/>`__, 
you can see examples of using cURL to 
send requests to the API endpoints 
for many Rackspace cloud services.
A shell is a program that emulates a terminal, 
enabling you to type commands and observe responses; 
`bash <http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`__ 
is a widely-used shell. 

At the 
`Developer Center <https://developer.rackspace.com/>`__, 
if you select 
*Shell* as your preferred language, 
you will see samples formatted for use at the command line 
with  
cURL.

You can use any tool that enables you to type a command, send it
as a request to a REST API's endpoint,  
and then examine the API's response.
