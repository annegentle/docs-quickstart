Rackspace implemented 
the OpenStack project named "neutron" 
as our Cloud Networks product.

The OpenStack tool primarily used for 
managing Cloud Networks is written
in Python and called *neutron*. 
It is also known as 
*python-neutronclient*.

We recommend that you use the 
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__ 
to install neutronclient, as it will handle installing dependencies and
required packages for you.

Alternatively, you can download the rackspace-neutronclient package from 
the 
`GitHub repository for rackspace-neutronclient <https://github.com/rackerlabs/rackspace-neutronclient>`__.

OpenStack documents that may help you install neutronclient 
and learn to use it include: 

* `Install the OpenStack command-line clients <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html>`__

* `OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/index.html>`__, 
  especially at 
  `Networking command-line client <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/neutronclient_commands.html>`__ 

* `Python bindings to the OpenStack Network API <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-neutronclient/>`__
