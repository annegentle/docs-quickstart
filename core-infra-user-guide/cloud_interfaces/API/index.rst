API & SDK: Developer and DevOps tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you write applications that are tightly integrated with 
the Rackspace cloud 
you may find that 
clicking to choose options in the Cloud Control Panel 
and typing to issue commands with CLIs 
are not ideal for
your purposes. 

If you develop or distribute applications for your customers, 
or if you wish to heavily automate operation of your 
cloud infrastructure,
you may need to interact with cloud services 
through one of the many available Software Development Kits 
or by 
direct API access.

If you are responsible for administering systems that are
used for cloud software development, 
you may want to investigate DevOps tools 
designed for this purpose.
