Cloud Servers and SDKs and APIs
-------------------------------
When you begin writing your own software
to interact with Cloud Servers, 
you may benefit from investing some time to learn about 
how Cloud Servers works
in the Cloud Control Panel 
and how SDKs and APIs are documented at Rackspace.

Cloud Servers API investigation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Using an API, 
you can write software to automate functions that could otherwise 
be performed manually by a person logged into the Cloud Control Panel. 
You can accelerate your understanding of how the API works 
by using the Cloud Control Panel to demonstrate the manual process 
before you begin to automate it; 
to interact with the Cloud Servers service, 
the Cloud Control Panel sends requests via the same API 
that you interact with when you write your own software. 

Sometimes, 
especially for new features that are not yet available 
in the Cloud Control Panel, 
you can write software to perform functions 
via the API 
that could not be performed in any other way; 
product announcements for Limited Availability 
and Early Access releases point out this limitation when it applies. 
In that case, 
experimenting in the Cloud Control Panel can show you 
only part of the process of working with a new feature; 
other details are described in the 
`API documentation <http://docs.rackspace.com>`__. 

Just as you can use the Cloud Control Panel 
to help you understand a manual process that you intend to automate, 
you can use the API documentation to help you understand 
how to use a Software Development Kit (SDK) 
in your favorite programming language. 

* The API documentation describes 
  *what* you can ask the API to do. 
  
* The SDK documentation demonstrates 
  *how* to ask the API to do something. 

Awareness of both API and SDK capabilities 
can help you to plan the easiest way to develop your software. 

After you understand what the Cloud Servers API is capable of 
and how to use an SDK to simplify interaction with the API, 
doing one more research task may save you the effort of 
writing your own software. 
Investigate whether the automation you require 
is already available from another Rackspace product or from 
a Rackspace partner. 
For example: 

* `Auto Scale <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/auto-scale>`__ 
  responds to workload peaks by increasing server capacity. 
 
* `Cloud Orchestration <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/orchestration>`__ 
  installs a complete application stack on a server.
    
* `Cloud Backup <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/backup>`__ 
  automates a server's backup schedule. 

Good places to investigate relevant capabilities 
available within the broader Rackspace portfolio include:

* Rackspace product summaries such as 
  `Rackspace Cloud Servers powered by OpenStack <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers>`__
* `Rackspace Community <https://community.rackspace.com/>`__
* `Rackspace Marketplace <https://marketplace.rackspace.com/listing?p=1&default=true&q#!/list/page/1/>`__
* `Rackspace Knowledge Center <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/>`__

Using the process suggested at 
:ref:`cloudservers_APIinvestigation`, 
here is an example of how you can plan 
and then write your own software to perform one simple task: 
list all your Cloud Servers. 

Learn about Cloud Servers in the Cloud Control Panel  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you login to the 
`Cloud Control Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__, 
your session begins with a list of all your Cloud Servers. 
By default, the list is unfiltered, 
showing every server; 
you can narrow the list by clicking on filters 
for tag, status, image, flavor, and type.

Learn about Cloud Servers in API documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the 
`API cross-reference <http://api.rackspace.com/>`__, 
you can see all available API operations for all cloud services. 
The operations are grouped according to the service they interact 
with (for example, Cloud Servers or Cloud Files) 
and the scope they act upon (for example, flavors or images). 

You can see all Cloud Servers operations in the  
`API cross-reference <http://api.rackspace.com/api-ref.html#compute-core-v2>`__; 
in the group of 
`operations that act upon servers <http://api.rackspace.com/api-ref.html#compute_servers>`__, 
you can see that:

* sending a ``GET`` to the ``/v2/{tenant_id}/servers`` 
  URI requests a requests a basic list of information about servers

* sending a ``POST`` to the same URI requests creation of a new server 

* sending a ``GET`` to the same URI and appending ``/detail`` 
  requests requests an expanded list of information about servers

.. figure:: ../../screenshots/CloudServersListServersGET.png
   :scale: 80%
   :alt: api.rackspace.com lists all API operations.
   
   The API cross-reference lists all API operations

On the first ``GET`` line, click *detail* to see 
more about how the API handles this request.  
The request parameters and sample response shown here can 
help you formulate a basic *List servers* request to the API 
and understand the API's 
response.  

You can use request parameters to construct a request that returns 
a list of only the Cloud Servers 
that meet specific criteria.  
In the sample response, 
The request parameters named ``status``, ``image``, and ``flavor`` 
correspond to the filters available on the Cloud Control Panel. 

In the 
`Getting Started Guide for the Cloud Servers API <http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/>`__, 
you can follow a 12-step tutorial to perform an essential task: 
create a Cloud Server. 
In the Getting Started Guide, 
the 
`tutorial <http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/ch_gs_getting_started_with_nova.html>`__
begins with instructions on creating a Rackspace account 
and concludes with deleting the Cloud Server that was created. 
An intermediate step 
demonstrates 
`obtaining a detailed list of Cloud Servers by using the cURL command-line interface (CLI) 
<http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/curl_list_servers.html>`__. 

Learn about Cloud Servers in SDK QuickStart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the 
`SDK QuickStart for Cloud Servers <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/getting-started/>`__,
you can see some of the same steps that are documented in 
the API's Getting Started Guide. 
For example, both the API-focused and SDK-focused documents 
show how to authenticate with your API key before issuing any requests 
to the Cloud Servers API. 
 
The SDK QuickStart adds examples in several popular programming 
languages, 
demonstrating how to use each language to 
code some commonly-used requests to the 
Cloud Servers API. 

To see examples in a specific language, 
click that language's name in the list across the top of the page. 
For example, to see Cloud Servers code samples coded in python, 
go to the 
`SDK QuickStart for Cloud Servers <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/getting-started/>`__ 
and click *python*.

Use SDK to help you write and run code to interact with Cloud Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The SDK QuickStart demonstrates a few basic requests; 
for more detailed guidance, 
perhaps enough to walk you through exactly the steps required 
to develop your software, examine the SDK itself. 

To find the full SDK for your programming language, start at 
`SDKs & Tools in the Developer Center <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/>`__ 
and find the language. 
Then follow the steps appropriate to that language. 

For example, if you code in python, 

* Follow the installation instructions to give yourself 
  a local copy of the pyrax (python for Rackspace) SDK. 
* Click *documentation* to open the 
  `GitHub repository for the pyrax SDK <https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/>`__. 
* In that pyrax repository, at 
  `/docs/cloud_servers.md <https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/blob/master/docs/cloud_servers.md>`__,
  read *Working with Cloud Servers*. 
  That document begins with an 
  `example of using pyrax to list servers <https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/blob/master/docs/cloud_servers.md#listing-servers>`__.
