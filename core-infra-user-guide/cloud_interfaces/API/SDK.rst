Software Development Kits (SDKs)
--------------------------------
Software development kits provide
easy to use, language-specific interfaces 
for accessing and integrating
APIs into your applications and workflows. 
Often these libraries also
abstract the functionality required to support your applications and
workloads across multiple cloud endpoints or providers.

Rackspace supports SDKs for the following languages:

* Go

* Java

* .Net

* Node.js

* PHP

* Python

* Ruby

You can find links to all the Rackspace-supported SDKs, with
installation instructions, guidance, tutorials, and more for each, 
in the 
`Rackspace Developer Center <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/>`__.
