Learning more about SDKs and APIs

Rackspace continuously improves 
the SDKs and APIs we support. 
We publish release notes to
announce new features, bug fixes, and other changes.

Watch for release notes announcing changes to the SDKs at https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/. 
You can subscribe to 
an Atom feed for each SDK's release notes 
so you are notified when we update them.
