The managed cloud in context
----------------------------
The Rackspace managed cloud, our public cloud, is built to comply with
the open-source `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org/>`__ specification.
We're a founder of OpenStack and we continue to contribute to its
ongoing development. When your workload runs in our managed cloud, it's
managed and supported by Rackers on Rackspace infrastructure in
Rackspace data centers. The flexibility of OpenStack backed by the
support of Rackspace is a unique and powerful combination; as a user of
our managed cloud, you can expect to benefit from that synergy.

If someday you choose to work with OpenStack but prefer not to do so
within the Rackspace managed cloud, you can expect that transition to be
easy.

-  You can use our `Managed Private
   Cloud <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private>`__ product to create
   and operate your own cloud on infrastructure managed by Rackspace.

-  You can install OpenStack yourself, on your own equipment, and manage
   your own cloud on your own infrastructure.

-  You can find another provider and use their OpenStack-compliant
   public cloud.
