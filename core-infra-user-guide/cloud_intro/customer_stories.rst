Customer stories
----------------
You have big ideas of your own, but thinking about what other customers
have accomplished in the Rackspace cloud may give you some new
inspiration. To learn about customers who have used the cloud to help them
meet some of the same challenges you are facing, start at
`rackStories: Rackspace customer culture <http://stories.rackspace.com/customers>`__. 

Other good places to find
customer stories include:

* `case studies and white papers in the Knowledge Center <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/case-studies-white-papers>`__

* `postings in the "Partner & Customer Updates" channel of the Rackspace blog <http://www.rackspace.com/blog/channels/partner-and-customer-updates/>`__

* `postings from Racker and customer developers in the Rackspace developer blog <https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/>`__

* `discussions with Rackers and customers in the Rackspace Community <https://community.rackspace.com/>`__
